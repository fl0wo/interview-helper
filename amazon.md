  <summary>Tell the last time you worked more than your task asked you to</summary>
  <pre>
  <strong>SITUATION</strong>:  I was doing an university databases project (also mentioned in my cv).
  <strong>TASK</strong>:       I had to build a service to manage Gym acesses during covid pandemic, with
              a database, server and a client website.
  <strong>ACT</strong>:        Instead of just finishing the project quickly I decided to invest in my self
              in long-term, adding more features to the infrastructure of that project as like:
              Swagger, CI/CD, Liquidbase, Angular etc.
  <strong>RESULT</strong>:     The professor admired me, he saw the passion in me and rewarded me with great votes.
  </pre>
  <pre>
  <strong>SITUATION</strong>:  Whenever I correctly solve a competitive programming problem.
  <strong>TASK</strong>:       And I see it's a great solution that comes up on the top10 solutions world-wide.
  <strong>ACT</strong>:        Instead of just skipping on the next problem, I take some extra time tring to reach
              the top1 solution time/memory consuming speaking. I always try to get to the top. 
              Pratically speaking I usually take some more extra ms making I/O operations quicker.
  <strong>RESULT</strong>:     This affects me making me more confident, and it really reminds me that anything 
              could get better than it already is.

  <summary>Tell me about a time you disagreed with a superior.</summary>
  <pre>
  <strong>SITUATION</strong>:  We had a really simple NON URGENT business story to implement in order to call an Api service.
  <strong>TASK</strong>:       I disagreed with my superior because I was convinct that before jumping into implementation
                               we had a little ambitious refactoring to do before, in order to avoid time-wasting in the future.
                               Basically we had to avoid using third-party responses models, but convert them to our logic, with
                               our fields naming and so on, and only than proceed with the implementation of the solution.
  <strong>ACT</strong>:        My superior was furious knowing that I was "wasting time with a refactoring" and still after 4 days
                               of work didnt even start with the real implementation. I kindly tried to explane to him we really 
                               needed this in order to avoid problems in a near future but he really tought I was wrong and was just
                               doing something extra that wasnt really required in order to finish the task. So he ordered me to
                               roolback all the changes and finish it as quickly as possible, that wasnt an urgent task but for some
                               reason my superior was upset. The next day I tryed to ask to another co-worker if my refactoring makes
                               sense or not, and he gave me the courague to call my superior back and try to convinct him that my
                               initial instinct was correct. After carefully listening to me he decided to give me a canche, I finished
                               the work in few days giving extra effort. 
  <strong>RESULT</strong>:     Luck wanted that the stories of the following sprint were much similar, and plenty time was gained thanks
                               to the refactoring I made, all mappings were easier to implement and all the sprint stories were DONE in 
                               one day instead of one week. I noticed after that episode that I earned his trust and he was more interested
                               in my toughts than before.

  <summary>Tell me about a time when you succeeded despite being under pressure</summary>
  <pre>
  <strong>SITUATION</strong>:  I was studing for ASD oral exam. There were rumors about that professor
                               being one of the most sever professors of the Uni, expecially if you did great
                               on the first mod1 and mod2 ASD written exams.
  <strong>TASK</strong>:       I was scared to disappoint the professor that expected a lot from me, also I really
                               wanted to pass the exam in order to avoid giving mod1 & mod2 again in the next year.
  <strong>ACT</strong>:        I had to work under pressure, scheduling my free-time, avoiding distractions. I was
                               really determinated, I studied every day till late night post work, I sacrificed so many
                               things and I avoided hanging out with friends for few months.
                               But I also remeber I had to go to the gym often to release the pressure.
  <strong>RESULT</strong>:     I passed the exam with no problems at all, the professor was happy and I was so proud of me.
                               I lerned that if I want to I can work under pressure, and I also work better under pressure 
                               cause I delete distractions in order to overcome the problem in the best productive way possible.

                               really urgent and the customer needed this as soon as possible.
  <strong>ACT</strong>:        For the seek of the company, and the customer feedback I decided to ask my superior if I 
                               could stop working on my task for few days and help my colleague.
  <strong>RESULT</strong>:     We finished the work super fast because the customer criteria was exactly as mine when I
                               first developed the solution for the same problem. The customer was happy, my colleague also,
                               and I come back working on my stuff knowing that one day I could also seek for help on trouble.
